# Official Dockerfile for EdgeDB Server

## What is EdgeDB?

EdgeDB is an **open-source** object-relational database built on top of
PostgreSQL. The goal of EdgeDB is to _empower_ its users to build safe
and efficient software with less effort.

EdgeDB features:

- strict, strongly typed schema;
- powerful and expressive query language;
- rich standard library;
- built-in support for schema migrations;
- native GraphQL support.

See [edgedb.com](https://www.edgedb.com/) and the

EdgeDB and how to get started.
